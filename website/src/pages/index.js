        A modern web application will be a master app which is composed of many modules together.

Module splitting helps you reduce the area when something goes wrong, easily unit test and manage the quality.

When the module initialization fails, it will try again, if it fails again it will be retry by the fallback version of the module. Finally, if it still fails, it will handle it to avoid page errors.
