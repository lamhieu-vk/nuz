## What is Micro Frontends?

Micro Frontends architecture is a Microservices architecture approach to frontend web development. Micro Frontends allows building a feature-rich modern web application based on Microservices architecture.

The same Backend Monolith, The Frontend Monolith still meets some problems from Monolith architecture. To resolve these problems, Micro Frontends was mentioned, use Micro Frontends for the application to helps all teams can be released the new features independently, grows teams, develop and maintain the features easier, keep the codebase small and operations stable.

> The concept of Micro Frontends is to think about the application that will be developed by the independent teams, each team having owned and managed a distinct area of business that it specializes in.

## Why Micro Frontend matters?

At this time, the new web applications having rich-features and grow up every day, the codebase and team members will be larger and larger. This makes the manage and scalability gets more difficult.

The transformation is needed if the business want to applied the new technologies, building many the features to compete, stuck at scalability or take many time don't necessary for the process at develop, maintain and release a feature or bugfix for the web application because codebase large, build time is long or dependent by another teams. Delayed to transform will be made the transform process in the future is harder and consuming resources.

## Benefits of Micro Frontend

A Micro Frontend leads to easier, faster, and more efficient front-end development. But how does it do so? Here are some of the key advantages of Micro Frontends.

### Independent deployment

One of the key features of Micro Frontends is independent development. The team can be hosted each module or service has its own continuous delivery pipelines anywhere and by the self way.

These pipelines are responsible for building, testing, and deploying each module all the way to production. Therefore, teams can be autonomous in developing, correcting and releasing them freely without having to wait or be dependent on another party.

But remember, when an error occurs from a module or service it must be controlled and not affected by the other teams even on production.

### Better code management

The use of Micro Frontends in development makes the codebase of each module or service small and can be distributed in many places, managed by the teams. Also because the codebase is small, debugging and maintenance is much easier, the code is cleaner, and unit testing of the modules will be more efficient.

### Autonomous teams

Dividing teams by features, each member of the team will understand the functionality of the feature better, thereby making it easy to come up with ideas as well as update to better carry products. In addition, when a team has a full range of technical members from Backend to Frontend, they manage their own things, so when it comes to making technical decisions, it's more optimal.

### Reusable modules

With Micro Frontends, each component, module or service has to be independent, so it's easier to reuse those things, it can be reused in the application or in cross applications together. In addition, using Nuz you can do so much more.
